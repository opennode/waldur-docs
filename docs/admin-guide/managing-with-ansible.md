# Managing Waldur with Ansible

**NB!** Repository with Ansible playbooks for Waldur management is not open-sourced. It is available to Waldur users
that have purchased support packages.

## Compatibility

Ansible version 2.9 is supported; code in this repository may work with other Ansible versions but it is not guaranteed.

## Quick setup

1. Make sure that you have:
    - Folder containing managed-ansible Ansible installer (this one).
    - Folder containing deployment-specific settings.
2. Copy `setup_deployment.sh.example` to `setup_deployment.sh`, adjust:
    - INSTALLER_PATH - full path to current folder
    - DEPLOYMENT_CONFIG_PATH - full path to folder with deployment-specific information
    - DEPLOYMENT_IDS - list of deployment IDs you want to manage.
3. Run ./setup_deployment.sh. This will create required symlinks.
4. Run `ansible-playbook -DC <deployment_id.yml>` to check what installer will do.
5. Run `ansible-playbook -D <deployment_id.yml>` to apply the installer.


## Upgrading installer

1. Download a new archive into a separate folder and unpack.
2. Check what has changed:
    ```rsync --dry-run -avzh unpacked-folder-eg-ansible-3.2.3/ /path/to/installer/```
3. Do the upgrade:
    ```rsync -avzh unpacked-folder-eg-ansible-3.2.3/ /path/to/installer/```

## Upgrading Waldur

Upgrading Waldur to a new version is achieved by following the checklist:

1. Update deployment-specific variables for the new version in `groups_vars/<deployment_id>/vars` and `groups_vars/<deployment_id>/vault` (if setting is private).
2. Update target version in `groups_vars/<deployment_id>/vars`: set `waldur_homeport_version` and `waldur_mastermind_version` to a new version of the Waldur release.
3. Run `ansible-playbook -DC <deployment_id.yml>` to check what installer will do during the upgrade.
4. Run `ansible-playbook -D <deployment_id.yml>` to perform an upgrade.

## Add new deployment

Infrastructure:

 1. Prepare servers matching [requirements](https://github.com/waldur/waldur-docs/blob/master/docs/admin-guide/hardware-requirements/requirements.md).
 2. Make sure you can access them by SSH by running only `ssh <host>`. Otherwise you should tweak `~/.ssh/config` file or describe connectivity in the Ansible inventory.

Ansible (this repository):

 1. Add new deployment-specific host group to `hosts` file (example: `[foo]`); add hosts to this group.
 2. Add hosts to Waldur role groups in `hosts` file.
 3. Add variable files for new deployment: `group_vars/foo/vars` and `group_vars/foo/vault`
 4. Add deployment specific information under `deployments` folder.
 5. Copy existing playbook that is the closest match for a new deployment; modify as needed
 6. Run Ansible playbook to set up deployment: `ansible-playbook -D foo.yml`

## Remove deployment

Ansible (this repository):

 1. Delete deployment-specific playbook, roles, tasks, templates etc.
 2. Delete variable files: `rm -rf group_vars/foo`
 3. Delete deployment-specific host group and all deployment-specific hosts from `hosts` file (example: `[foo]`)
 
## Managing Waldur deployed as Helm
