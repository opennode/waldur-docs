# Service Desk integrations

Waldur supports integrations with several widely used service desk solutions like Jira,
Zammad and Microfocus SMAX. Integration with the mentioned service desk solutions allows the creation of
support requests directly from Waldur. In addition, replies from the support personnel are synchronised with Waldur so
that the end users are never directly exposed to the service desk software.

Users can see the issues' history and the current status of active tickets.
