# API index

Waldur is developed according to the API-first approach. This means that all information, which is available in the UI, is also available via REST API. Here is the list of the endpoints of the main modules of Waldur:

- [Authentication](authentication-api.md)
- [User](user-api.md)
- [Organization](organization-api.md)
- [Marketplace](marketplace-api.md)
- [Reporting](reporting-api.md)
- [Accounting](accounting-api.md)

Technical guide for API integration is available [as well](../integrator-guide/APIs/api.md).
