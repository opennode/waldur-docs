# Broadcast

The broadcast functionality allows you to send messages to specific groups of users within Waldur. You can target messages to the following:

* Offering users
* Organization members
* All users connected to your Waldur deployment

## Management of broadcast messages

To manage broadcast messages, follow these steps:

* Select **Support** from the left-side menu.
* Click **Broadcast** in the top menu.

The Broadcast Management page shows both sent messages and drafts. From here, you can view message history and create new broadcasts.

* Navigate to **Support** → **Broadcast templates**.
* Click **Add**.

A popup will appear with the following fields:

* **Name**: Name of the template
* **Subject**: Subject line for the broadcast message
* **Message**: Content of the message
