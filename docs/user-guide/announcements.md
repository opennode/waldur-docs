# Announcements

The Waldur User Interface provides an easy way to inform users about important updates and changes through announcements.

Currently, there are three types of announcements:

* **Information** – Provides general updates, new features, or helpful tips.
* **Warning** – Alerts users about potential issues or changes that may affect their experience.
* **Danger** – Signals critical issues, errors, or risks that require immediate action.

## Announcement management

1. Navigate to **Administration** → **Settings** → **Announcements**.
