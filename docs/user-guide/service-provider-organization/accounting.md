### Service provider revenue

If the organization is service provider, then it is possible to check the amount of revenue of a running month. To do that, open the organization dashboard, choose "Service provider" view and then dashboard opens. There you will see the total amount of estimated revenue and also 11 previous months.

By clicking on "Active clients" on the left, it's possible to see more detailed information about clients and amounts.
