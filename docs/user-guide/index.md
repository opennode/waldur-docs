# User Guide

From this section, you can find useful and practical action for completing the most common tasks.

Please note that the user guide preparation work is in progress, and we will add new instructions continuously.

Practical guides:

* [Interface overview](interface.md)
* [Organization and project management](organization_and_project_management.md)
* [Project membership management](project_membership_management.md)
* [Marketplace](marketplace.md)
* [Accounting and reporting](usage_reports.md)
* [Projects removal by admin](projects-removal-admin.md)

For the old user interface, you can check the [old version](https://opennode.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/WD/pages/22976598/User+Guide),
but keep in mind that some parts are outdated.
