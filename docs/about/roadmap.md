# Roadmap

## Disclaimer

This document is a living document and is used for planning. Plans for the unreleased features can change without
further notice and hence cannot be used as a guaranteed delivery plan, the features can be delivered both
earlier and later.

Roadmap is created based on the backlog and requests from the existing users of Waldur. If you are interested in a
specific topic, please [reach out](./support.md) to us.

Some of the tasks are common and some are functional, listed below.

## Continuous improvements

### Documentation

There is no such thing as a perfect documentation so we are constantly working on improving it.

### CI/CD

We believe that automation is a key to improving quality of code and happiness of developers, so we are
constantly working on improving CI/CD related aspects.

### Tests

A good software is a reliable software, so we are always trying to add more sensible tests.

## Functional

The list below is based on the Epics maintained in Waldur's task manager. They are labelled with  domains, which
have requested them. Domains are:

- **Generic** - Common requirements, no extra label.
- **Academia** - originating from the research community;
- **Commercial** - originating from the commercial deployments;
- **Government** - originating from the public sector deployments.
